# Supply Chain Project
The purpose of this project is to go out and snarf up product catalog information from various medical supplier website (e.g. MedLine) and try to make some generalized sense out of the products and information available there.

The intent is that this information can then be combined together with internal information about cases, encounters, and analysis related to those products.

# Process
* Snarf data
* Convert to standardized JSON
* Load to Solr
* Run "more like this analysis" to do classification

# Use import.io wherever possible
